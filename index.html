                <p>Food should be eaten only when you are hungry. Eat when you are hungry and eat healthy food. It is
                    not

                <p>Never skip breakfast or breakfast. This reduces our metabolic rate, increases weight and increases
                    digestion problems. Breakfast helps us concentrate and control our weight.</p>
